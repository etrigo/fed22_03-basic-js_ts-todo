# A simple todo web app in TypeScript et all
### How it works
The app initializes with a few dummy todos. From that the user can check todos by clicking the checkbox in the todo list. If todo is checkled its moved to the finnished todos list and are crossed over.
* Finnished todos can be unchecked and are then moved back to the active todos list.
* User can sort the the todo list alphabetically from A-Z or from Z-A by clicking the sort button.
* User can add new todo by filling in the input field and clicking the "Add to list" button
The next feature for the att would be a function to remove a todo completly. But this project was mainly to disply an basic understanding of TypeScript which current functionality does.
As an extra feature the app uses local storage to store todos and current sort state.
### Tech
To setup the environment Parcel.js was used as adviced. To style the app at least one style framework was supposed to be used so Flexbox was selected. The styling was written in SASS and ofcourse the scripting was done with TypeScript.
